### Abstract
In this study, a probabilistic electricity price forecasting scheme is proposed for the volatile UK market. The proposed scheme utilizes Quantile Regression (QR) with general predictors and excludes market-specific variables to ensure adaptability. When forecasting day-ahead electricity prices, the scheme employs a set of quantile models that integrate lagged price data, demand forecasts, and renewable energy generation forecasts (solar and wind) to train the regression models. Additionally, the proposed approach incorporates real-time data retrieval via an API to enable automated day-ahead forecasting, ensuring accuracy and operational efficiency.

## Structure of the code

The proposed model consists of multiple code files. By running api_DAP.py and api_SSP.py first, followed by predict_price.py, it is possible to perform real-time predictions while retrieving data via the APIs.
